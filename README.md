# Optimised L* Based AG Reasoning Framework

Python implementation of the L* based Assume Guarantee Reasoning framework, specifically designed to support the verification and validation of dynamic input deterministic finite automata (DFAs). The framework integrates five distinct optimisation methods to enhance operational efficiency.

The primary application domain for this implementation is autonomous vehicles, whereby the ability to dynamically adapt to changing inputs and conditions is critical. By employing framework, this tool can systematically learn and refine the models of autonomous vehicle behavior, ensuring that the vehicles operate safely and efficiently in a variety of environments. The optimisations embedded in the framework are tailored to handle the real-time demands and intricate decision-making processes inherent in autonomous driving systems.

Extensive testing and validation has been conducted using autonomous vehicle behaviour as a benchmark, demonstrating the practical utility and reliability of the framework. The integration of multiple optimisation methods has shown significant improvements in the learning speed and accuracy of the models, making this tool highly suitable for real-world applications whereby dynamic input DFAs are utilised.

## Installation

Python 3.6 as standard - please check requirements.txt for dependencies.

## Usage

The main functional directory, considering the three optimisation methods referenced from Chaki & Strichman are situated within the ag_opt directory. 

Novel optimisation methods four and five are situated in opt_4 and opt_5 directories, respectively. 

Navigate to the respective directory and run the run_ag.py script to execute the AG reasoning process. 

It must be noted that the ag directory is simply L* based AG Reasoning without any form of optimisation or subsequent related alterations. 

It also must be noted that ag includes standardised unit testing functions, whilst opt_5 includes context-aware adjustment functionality.

## Configuration

Configuration settings are managed using Hydra. You can find the configuration files in the conf directory of each optimisation method. Modify the YAML files to change parameters such as search depth, maximum length, and the number of runs.

## Optimisation Methods

### Optimisation Method 1: Reusing Counterexamples

This method reuses counterexamples from previous iterations to avoid redundant queries and speed up the learning process.

### Optimisation Method 2: Selective Membership Queries

This method optimises the learning process by selectively performing membership queries based on a predefined threshold.

### Optimisation Method 3: Alphabet Minimisation

This method minimises the assumption alphabet to improve the learning process efficiency.

### Optimisation Method 4: Adaptive Query Selection

This method dynamically selects queries based on the current state of the learning process to improve efficiency.

### Optimisation Method 5: Reuse of Counterexamples

This method improves the hypothesis merging process to reduce the number of iterations required for convergence.
